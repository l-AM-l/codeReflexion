            <h1>First thoughts</h1>
            <p>In this project we were told to create a site based on one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), our team decided on doing the SDG number 4, being the Quality and Education theme. We thought on plenty if ideas of what we could do but all the ideas that came to mind ended up being very average and done a lot of time before.
              That's we came to the idea to just make an educational website that has free accesss to veryone and learn basics skills at the comodity of your home so that all kinds od people depensing of any kind of situation can have the ability and more importantly free right to an education.</p>

        <h2>Structure and design</h2>
        <p>Before coding, it is always important to have a clear idea on how to webSIte will look like and understand the aesthetic the site its trying to achieve. We made some sketches but mosta of them were pretty bland and mostly text, but after many tries we reached the following examples:   </p>

          <img src="img/Clipboard 2023-12-04 01-48-09.jpg" class="imgStruct">

        </div>
        <h3>Prototype</h3>
        <p>As you can see, the team started to understand what the idea was and we took that design and started making the prototype. The prototype, being the first ever advance of our project was relatively easy, just making the skeleton of the project using only HTML, CSS and a little bit of bootstrap, but a little tedious by trying to make the website good to look at. In this stage of the project, we managed to run the website smoothly because of the simple code and easy to learn markup languages. </p>  
        <p>By using only HTML and CSS the divided their share by the following: introduction or home page, courses, and courses content. Being the forst stage of the deilivery, the only issues in code were making sure there wasnt any big changes in diferent devices (making the code responsive)</p>

        <h1>Overall thoughts</h1>
        <p>In conclusion, the web development final project has been a comprehensive learning experience, covering a range of key concepts and skills in the field. Throughout the project, we gained proficiency in front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, enabling us to create an interactive and visually appealing user interface. </p>
        <p>The use of a modern front-end framework, like React or Angular, may have enhanced the project's structure and maintainability.
          >
                    On the back end, we delved into server-side programming, database management, and possibly utilized a framework like Node.js, Django, or Flask. This allowed us to handle data, implement server logic, and ensure the seamless functioning of the application.</p>
